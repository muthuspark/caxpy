			<h3>Try out Caxpy!</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<div class="entry-content">
					<h4 class="title">Prerequisites</h4>
					<p>All you need&nbsp;in order to start using Caxpy&nbsp;is Java 7 (or higher) and a server that can run Capy, preferably Tomcat 7+. Only a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is required and not the full-blown JDK (Java Development Kit).<br>
					There is a good chance that Java is already installed on your system and you can verify whether it is ready to run Caxpy&nbsp;by opening a command prompt and typing the following command:<br>
					<code><br>
					java -version<br>
					</code><br>
					If the system responds with a java version that is 1.7 or greater, you are ready to download and run Caxpy.<br>
					You can download Java from here: http://www.java.com/download.</p>
					<p>To install Tomcat you can follow the steps mentioned here</p>
					<p><a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/setup.html">https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/setup.html</a></p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h4 class="title">Quick Installation</h4>
					<p>Once you have Java and Tomcat installed, you can copy the Caxpy.war file and put that inside webapps folder of tomcat. Caxpy&nbsp;embeds HSQLDB&nbsp;and doesn’t need any external database system.</p>
					<div class="itemizedlist">
					<ul type="disc">
					<li>First, download the latest release from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/caxpy/files/latest/download">the Caxpy&nbsp;downloads area</a></li>
					<li>Copy the downloaded war file into Tomcat’s webapp directory</li>
					<li>Restart tomcat if required, you should be able to see caxpy folder created inside “webapps” on successful deployment.</li>
					<li>Point your web-browser to <a href="http://localhost:8080/caxpy">http://localhost:8080/caxpy</a>&nbsp;(Your tomcat may be running in different port, use the one your tomcat is configured )</li>
					<li><strong>Login into the application using username : max and password : password</strong><br></li>
					<li>Start using&nbsp;Caxpy</li>
					</ul>
					</div>
					<p>Remote users should be able to access Caxpy&nbsp;over the network by using the machine name instead of “localhost” in the URL shown above. If there is a problem, it could be due to a firewall running on the machine where Caxpy&nbsp;is installed – and you may have to reconfigure things so that for example “java.exe” is not blocked.</p>
					<h2>Notes for Linux / Unix users</h2>
					<div class="sect2" lang="en">
					<p>Everything&nbsp;will work unchanged as long as Java has been installed correctly i.e. “java” is in the PATH and it is the expected 1.7 or greater version. You may need to do things like apply executable permissions to the webapps folder on Linux, e.g. “chmod +x *.sh”. And also – unless you have “root” permissions, you may face problems starting services on port 8080 etc.</p>
					</div>
					<p>
					<strong>Login into the application using username : max and password : password</strong><br>
